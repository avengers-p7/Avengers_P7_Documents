# Introduction 
Secure your AWS cloud instances with the power of security groups! This guide provides clear instructions and real-world examples to help you configure effective security group rules in AWS. Think of security groups as virtual firewalls protecting your valuable resources, controlling the flow of incoming and outgoing traffic.

# Pre-requisites
To get started, you'll need:
- Access to the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI with permissions to create and manage security groups.
- A clear understanding of the network traffic your application requires, including protocols, ports, and source IP addresses.
