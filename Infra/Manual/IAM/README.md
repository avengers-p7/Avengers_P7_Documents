## Introduction
Custom IAM (Identity and Access Management) policies allow organizations to finely control access to AWS (Amazon Web Services) resources according to their specific requirements. While AWS provides predefined policies, custom IAM policies offer tailored access control, granting or denying permissions based on specific conditions.

## Why Create custom IAM policies
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Clarity and Organization**| Information is presented in a structured manner, making it easier for readers to understand policy components.|
| **Conciseness**	| Tabular formats allow for concise representation of policy elements, aiding in understanding permissions/resources.|
| **Readability**	| Tables provide visually appealing presentation, enhancing readability and comprehension of IAM policy details.|
| **Easy Comparison**	| Side-by-side display enables easy comparison of permissions, actions, and resources across different policies.|
| **Quick Reference**	| Tables serve as quick reference guides, facilitating efficient location of specific permissions or resources.|
| **Documentation Standardization**	| Adopting a consistent tabular format aids in standardizing IAM policy documentation, supporting collaboration.|

## Features of Custom IAM Policies
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Granular Control** |	Custom IAM policies enable organizations to define precise permissions, specifying actions users or roles can perform on AWS resources with fine granularity.|
|**Conditional Access**	| Policies can include conditions based on attributes like time, IP address, or resource tags, adding layers of security and flexibility to access control mechanisms.|
|**Versioning and Rollback**	| IAM policies support versioning, allowing organizations to track changes over time and rollback to previous versions if necessary, ensuring policy management robustness.|
| **Integration with AWS Services**	| Custom policies seamlessly integrate with various AWS services such as IAM roles, S3 bucket policies, and resource-based policies for services like Lambda and SQS.|

##  Advantages of Custom IAM Policies
| Aspect | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Tailored Access Control**	| Organizations can create policies precisely matching their security and compliance needs, reducing the risk of over-permissive access to AWS resources.|
|**Least Privilege Principle**	| Custom policies adhere to the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions for users or roles to fulfill their tasks, enhancing security posture.|
| **Flexibility and Scalability**	| Custom policies offer flexibility to adjust access control according to evolving business requirements and scale permissions as AWS infrastructure expands.|
| **Enhanced Security**| Custom IAM policies leverage conditions and constraints to bolster security measures, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and potential security breaches.|
