# Documentation of Jenkins Plugin Installation 

# Introduction 
Blue Ocean is a revolutionary plugin for Jenkins, offering a modern and intuitive user interface that transforms the experience of creating, visualizing, and managing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Introduced by CloudBees, Blue Ocean represents a significant departure from the traditional Jenkins interface, which was often criticized for its complexity and lack of user-friendliness. With Blue Ocean, users are greeted with a sleek and streamlined interface that prioritizes simplicity, clarity, and ease of use. One of its standout features is the graphical pipeline visualization, which provides a visual representation of CI/CD pipelines, making it easier for users to understand the structure and track the progress of builds. 

# What is Blue Ocean?

Blue Ocean rethinks the Jenkins user experience. Designed from the ground up for Jenkins Pipeline and compatible with Freestyle jobs, Blue Ocean reduces clutter and increases clarity for every member of your team through the following key features:

**Sophisticated visualizations of CD pipelines** for fast and intuitive comprehension of software pipeline status.

**Pipeline editor** that makes automating CD pipelines approachable by guiding the user through an intuitive and visual process to create a pipeline.

**Personalization** of the Jenkins UI to suit the role-based needs of each member of the DevOps team.

**Pinpoint precision** when intervention is needed and/or issues arise. The Blue Ocean UI shows where in the pipeline attention is needed, facilitating exception handling and increasing productivity.

**Native integration for branch and pull requests** enables maximum developer productivity when collaborating on code with others in GitHub and Bitbucket.

# Advantages of the Blue Ocean of Jenkins 

Blue Ocean brings several advantages to Jenkins users, making pipeline development, visualization, and management more accessible and efficient. Some of the key advantages of Blue Ocean include:

|Componments|Description|
|------------|----------|
|Intuitive User Interface |Blue Ocean offers a modern and user-friendly interface that simplifies the process of creating and managing CI/CD pipelines. Its intuitive design reduces the learning curve for new users and improves overall productivity|
|Graphical Pipeline Visualization |Blue Ocean provides a visual representation of CI/CD pipelines, allowing users to easily understand the structure and flow of their pipelines. This graphical visualization enhances clarity and makes it simpler to track the progress of builds through different stages|
|Streamlined Pipeline Creation | With Blue Ocean's visual pipeline editor, users can create and modify pipelines using a drag-and-drop interface. This eliminates the need for manual Jenkinsfile coding, making pipeline creation more accessible to developers and other team members|
|Integrated Code Editor | Blue Ocean includes an integrated code editor that allows users to edit Jenkins files directly within the UI. This seamless integration streamlines the process of making changes to pipeline code and improves developer workflow|
|GitHub Integration | Blue Ocean seamlessly integrates with GitHub, enabling users to create pipelines for GitHub projects and trigger builds based on code changes, pull requests and branches. This integration enhances collaboration and supports modern software development practices.|
|Personalization and Customization|Blue Ocean offers personalization options, allowing users to customize their dashboard with custom pipeline views and configurations. This enables users to organize pipelines based on their projects or teams and tailor their Jenkins experience to suit their needs|
|Built-in Analytics and Insights |Blue Ocean provides built-in analytics and insights to track pipeline performance metrics such as execution times, success rates, and resource utilization. This empowers users to optimize their CI/CD processes and improve overall efficiency |
|Enhanced Debugging and Troubleshooting| Blue Ocean offers features for easily re-running failed pipeline builds or specific stages within a pipeline. It also provides enhanced debugging capabilities, such as viewing logs and debugging failed builds directly from the UI, which helps in identifying and resolving issues more efficiently |

# Disadvantages of the Blue Ocean of Jenkins 


While Blue Ocean offers significant benefits to Jenkins users, there are some potential disadvantages to consider:

|Components | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
|Resource Intensiveness| Blue Ocean's modern UI and graphical features may consume more system resources compared to the traditional Jenkins UI. This could lead to performance issues on older or resource-constrained hardware, potentially impacting overall Jenkins performance|
|Learning Curve| While Blue Ocean aims to simplify the Jenkins experience, it introduces new concepts and workflows. Users who are accustomed to the traditional Jenkins UI may face a learning curve when transitioning to Blue Ocean, which could temporarily slow down productivity|
|Dependency on CloudBees| Blue Ocean was initially developed by CloudBees, and while it is open source, its development and support are closely tied to CloudBees. Users who prefer to avoid vendor lock-in may be cautious about relying heavily on a plugin with strong ties to a specific vendor|

 # Installing a plugin 

**Jenkins provides two methods for installing plugins on the controller**

**1. Using the "Plugin Manager" in the web UI**

 **2. Using the Jenkins CLI install-plugin command**


Each approach will result in the plugin being loaded by Jenkins but may require different levels of access and trade-offs to use.

The two approaches require that the Jenkins controller be able to download meta-data from an Update Center, whether the primary Update Center operated by the Jenkins project [1], or a custom Update Center.

The plugins are packaged as self-contained .hpi files, which have all the necessary code, images, and other resources that the plugin needs to operate successfully.


# From the web UI

The simplest and most common way of installing plugins is through the **Manage Jenkins > Plugins view**, available to administrators of a Jenkins environment.

Under the Available tab, plugins available for download from the configured Update Center can be searched and considered:

# Sonarqube 


SonarQube is an open-source platform developed for continuous inspection of code quality to perform automatic reviews with static analysis of code to detect bugs, code smells, and security vulnerabilities. Plugins extend the functionality of SonarQube to support additional languages, frameworks, and integrations.

|Components | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
|Access SonarQube Web Interface | To install plugins, you need access to the SonarQube server's web interface. Typically, this is accessed via a web browser|
|Login | You need appropriate permissions to install plugins. So, log in with an account that has administrative privileges|
|Navigate to Administration | In the SonarQube interface, there is usually an "Administration" tab or link. Click on it to access administrative settings|
|Plugin Marketplace |Within the Administration section, you'll typically find an option for "Marketplace" or "Update Center." This is where you can browse available plugins and install them|
|Browse and Select Plugin | In the marketplace, you can browse available plugins. They are often categorized by language or functionality. Select the plugin you want to install|
