# Introduction
This role is designed to automate the installation and configuration of Jenkins on target servers. Whether you're setting up Jenkins for continuous integration, continuous delivery, or other purposes, this role aims to simplify the process.

## Pre-requisites

Before using this Ansible role to set up Jenkins, ensure that the following prerequisites are met:

1. **Ansible:**
   - Ansible must be installed on the control machine from which you plan to run the playbook. If Ansible is not installed, you can install it using this [link](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html)

2. **SSH Access to Target Servers:**
   - Ensure that you have SSH access to the target servers where Jenkins will be installed.

# Steps 
* Before going further check the link for Ansible Role: https://github.com/vyadavP7/Jenkins-AnsibleRole

**Step 1: Dynamic Inventory Setup** 

```yaml
[defaults]

# some basic default values...


# Use AWS EC2 dynamic inventory for managing hosts
inventory      = aws_ec2.yml

# Disable SSH host key checking for convenience.
host_key_checking = False

# Specify the path to the private key file for SSH connections.
private_key_file = /path/to/private_key

Sets the remote user for SSH connections to 'ubuntu'
remote_user = ubuntu

[inventory]
# enable inventory plugins, default: 'host_list', 'script', 'auto', 'yaml', 'ini', 'toml'
enable_plugins = aws_ec2, host_list, virtualbox, yaml, constructed, script, auto, ini, toml
```

> [!NOTE]
>Ensure that the dynamic inventory script is properly configured with the necessary AWS credentials and filters to fetch the desired hosts.

**Step 2:  AWS EC2 Inventory**

```yaml
---
plugin: aws_ec2
regions:
  - eu-north-1

groups: 
  ubuntu: "'ubuntu' in tags.OS"
```

1. `plugin: aws_ec2`: Specifies the use of the aws_ec2 plugin as the dynamic inventory source. This plugin is designed to fetch information about EC2 instances in AWS.
2. `regions: - eu-north-1`: Indicates the AWS region(s) from which the dynamic inventory should fetch information. In this case, it's set to the eu-north-1 region.
3. `ubuntu: "'ubuntu' in tags.OS"`: Creates an Ansible group named ubuntu. This group includes EC2 instances where the tag named OS has a value of 'ubuntu'.

**Step 3: playbook.yml**
* This file is defining a set of tasks to be executed on hosts belonging to the ubuntu group.

```yaml
---
- hosts: ubuntu
  become: yes
  gather_facts: yes 
  roles:
    - jenkins      #includes role
```
**Step 4: Tasks**
1. `main.yml`: This main.yml file is acting as an orchestrator, importing tasks from the `install_jenkins.yml` file. This separation of tasks into different files is a good practice for better organization, especially when dealing with complex configurations or roles.

```yaml
---
# importing task files
- name: Include file to install softwares
  import_tasks: install_jenkins.yml
```
2. `Default` variables: This role comes with default values for the Jenkins repository URL and key URL. You can find these defaults in the `defaults/main.yml` file within the role directory.

```yaml
---
# defaults file for jenkins
jenkins_repo_url:  deb https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ 
jenkins_repo_key_url:  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key 
```

> [!NOTE]
> To customize the Jenkins version based on your specific requirements, you can override these default values in your playbook. This is particularly useful when you want to install a different version of Jenkins.


3. `install_jenkins.yml`: Ansible task folder for setting up Jenkins. It is split into several tasks. Let's break down each part.

```yaml
---
# Update APT cache
- name: Update APT cache
  apt:
    update_cache: yes

# Installs jdk if not installed already
- name: Ensure jdk is installed
  apt:
    name: default-jre
    state: present

# Adds the Jenkins repository's GPG key to the APT keyring
- name: Add Jenkins apt key in system.
  apt_key:
    url: "{{ jenkins_repo_key_url }}"
    state: present

# Add Jenkins apt repository
- name: Add Jenkins apt repository.
  apt_repository:
    repo: "{{ jenkins_repo_url }}"
    state: present
    update_cache: yes

# Install Jenkins
- name: Install jenkins 
  apt:
    name: jenkins
    state: present 

# Start Jenkins service
- name: Start service 
  service:
    name: jenkins 
    state: started 
    enabled: yes 

# Check Jenkins service status
- name: Check Jenkins service status
  systemd:
    name: jenkins
    state: started
  ignore_errors: yes
  register: jenkins_service_status

# Display Jenkins service status
- name: Display Jenkins service status
  debug:
    var: jenkins_service_status
```

**Step 4: Playbook Execution**

* To set up Jenkins on your target servers, you will execute the Ansible playbook using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook -i aws_ec2.yml playbook.yml
```

1. `ansible-playbook`: To run Ansible playbook

2. `-i aws_ec2.yml` : The -i option specifies the inventory file. In this case, it points to the aws_ec2.yml file, which contains information about your AWS EC2 instances.

3. `playbook.yml`: This is the main playbook file containing the instructions for setting up Jenkins. You can customize this playbook according to your requirements.

> Additional Options
> 
> --limit: You can use this option to specify a subset of hosts from the inventory on which the playbook should be executed.
> 
> -e or --extra-vars: You can pass extra variables to the playbook using this option.

## Output
1.  **Host-level output**: Output for each host would indicate whether the playbook execution was successful or not.

2. **Colorized Output**: Ansible uses colorized output to make it easier to identify successful, changed, or failed tasks. Successful tasks are often displayed in green, changed tasks in yellow, and failed tasks in red.

3. **Verify Tags**: Verify that the Jenkins installation is on the instance with the mentioned tags.
