# Introduction

The Cloud Infra Design 30k Feet documentation provides an in-depth overview of the Production, Development, Quality Assurance infrastructure hosted on AWS for the OT-Microservices project. This modern and modular architecture prioritizes scalability and efficiency, utilizing AWS services to establish a reliable, scalable, and high-performance foundation.

# Top-Down Approach

**Top-Down Approach Overview:**

Think of the top-down approach like looking at a big picture first. It's like standing on a hill and taking in the view of the entire landscape. In our Cloud Infra Design, this means starting with the overall plan, considering things like the main structure (VPCs), big locations (regions), and major elements like load balancers and databases. As we zoom in, we get into specifics like subnets, security groups, and individual services. This method helps us see the whole system strategically.

# Cloud Infra Design 30k Feet Details

Here's a flow summary of the infrastructure:

| Aspect                  | Details                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **User Access**         | Users connect to the infrastructure through the internet.                                          |
| **Public Subnets**      | Public subnets host components that need direct internet access. The Bastion Host is in the public subnet for secure access.                                   |
| **Private Subnets**     | Frontend application components are hosted in one private subnet. Attendance, Employee, and Salary APIs are in separate private subnets. PostgreSQL, Scylla, and Redis databases are in another private subnet.                             |
| **Security Groups**     | Different security groups are defined for various components: Bastion-sg for the Bastion Host, Frontend-sg for Frontend components, ATT-sg, EMP-sg, and Sal-sg for respective APIs, PSql-sg, Scylla-sg, and Redis-sg for database components.                         |
| **Internet Gateway & NAT Gateway** | Internet Gateway (Igw) facilitates internet access for the VPC. NAT Gateway allows instances in private subnets to initiate outbound traffic to the internet.                                 |
| **ALB (Application Load Balancer)** | ALB is configured for distributing frontend traffic across multiple targets, ensuring high availability.                                                  |
| **Region and Availability Zone** | The infrastructure is deployed in the Europe region, specifically in the Frankfurt (eu-central-1) region. Availability zones (eu-central-1a & eu-central-1b) are utilized for redundancy and fault tolerance.          |
| **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)** | Separate VPCs are created for Development, Production, and Quality Assurance environments. The flow summary outlines the path of user access, the organization of components in public and private subnets, the role of security groups, NACLs, internet and NAT gateways, routing, and the use of load balancing and auto-scaling for ensuring scalability and availability of services. |

# System Development Approaches

## Top-Down Approach System Development

|   | Description |
|---|-------------|
| **Definition** | In a top-down approach, the system is analyzed and designed from a broad perspective, starting with an overall view and breaking it down into smaller components. |
| **Methodology** | Begin with defining the overall structure and goals, and then progressively break them down into smaller components until the entire system is fully defined. |
| **Advantages**  | - Provides a high-level understanding of the system. <br/> - Easier to create an overall plan and strategy. <br/> - Helps in focusing on the main goals and functionalities. |

## Bottom-Up Approach System Development

|   | Description |
|---|-------------|
| **Definition** | In a bottom-up approach, the system is built by starting with the smallest, most basic elements and gradually combining them into larger, more complex structures. |
| **Methodology** | Begin with developing the smallest components independently and then integrate them into larger structures, eventually forming the complete system. |
| **Advantages**  | - Allows for early testing of individual components. <br/> - Often more flexible and adaptable to changes. <br/> - Useful in situations where the overall structure is not well-defined initially. |
