# Introduction

Creating Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) using Packer with Jenkins pipelines allows for efficient and automated infrastructure provisioning in AWS environments. Packer is a tool that automates the creation of machine images for multiple platforms, including AWS EC2 instances. When integrated with Jenkins pipelines, the process becomes streamlined and reproducible.

# What is Scripted Pipeline

A Scripted Pipeline in Jenkins is a Groovy-based approach to defining continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. It allows users to write pipeline scripts using Groovy syntax, providing full flexibility and customization for defining build, test, and deployment stages. Scripted Pipelines enable users to incorporate conditional logic, loops, and functions within the pipeline script to handle complex workflows and custom requirements. While offering extensive power and flexibility, Scripted Pipelines require users to have knowledge of Groovy programming and scripting concepts. They are well-suited for projects with intricate build processes or those requiring advanced automation and customization capabilities.

# Why Scripted Pipeline

| Aspect | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Imperative Syntax**        | Write pipelines as Groovy scripts, providing full control over execution flow for complex logic and dynamic behavior.                                           |
| **Programmatic Constructs**  | Access to programming features like loops, conditions, variables, and functions for building highly customizable pipelines.                                       |
| **Direct Access to APIs**    | Scripts directly interact with Jenkins APIs, enabling fine-grained automation and integration with plugins and external systems.                                 |
| **Extensibility**            | Allows for defining custom functions and importing external libraries to enhance pipeline functionality and reusability.                                          |
| **Legacy Support**           | Widely used in environments with existing pipelines, providing familiarity and compatibility with legacy systems.                                               |
| **Learning Curve**           | Requires understanding of Groovy syntax and Jenkins pipeline concepts, posing a steeper learning curve, especially for newcomers.                                |
| **Debugging and Maintenance** | Imperative nature can make debugging and maintenance challenging, necessitating proper organization, documentation, and testing practices.                     |

# What is "Packer"

<img width="360" length="100" alt="Golang" src="https://github.com/avengers-p7/Documentation/assets/156057205/6b8c1ba2-9c57-4d55-8092-04ea2eccaf84">

Packer, a powerful open-source tool developed by HashiCorp, has emerged as a preferred choice for creating AMIs. Offering multi-platform support, an infrastructure-as-code paradigm, and extensibility through various builders and provisioners, Packer streamlines the AMI creation process.

# Pre-requisites

| **Pre-requisites** | **Description** |
| ------------------ | --------------- |
| **Jenkins** | Latest version of Jenkins (2.426.2) |
| **Packer** | Latest version of Packer (Packer v1.10.1) |
| **Pipeline Plugin** | This is a must-have as it provides the infrastructure for defining and running your pipeline as code. |
| **AWS Credentials Plugin** | This plugin allows you to securely store your AWS credentials in Jenkins. |
| **Credentials Binding Plugin** | This plugin is useful for binding credentials to environment variables in your Jenkins pipeline. |
| **Pipeline AWS Plugin** | This plugin provides a set of reusable functions for working with AWS services in Jenkins pipelines. It's particularly helpful when interacting with AWS services like EC2 for building AMIs. |
| **Amazon EC2 Plugin** | While not directly related to Packer, this plugin is useful if you plan to use Jenkins to provision temporary build agents on EC2 instances. |

# Conclusion

In conclusion, integrating Packer with Jenkins pipelines offers a powerful solution for automating AMI creation in AWS environments. By defining infrastructure as code and leveraging the automation capabilities of Jenkins, teams can ensure consistency, reliability, and scalability in their infrastructure provisioning workflows. With Packer handling the image creation process and Jenkins orchestrating the pipeline execution, teams can streamline their development and deployment processes, ultimately leading to faster delivery of applications and services.
