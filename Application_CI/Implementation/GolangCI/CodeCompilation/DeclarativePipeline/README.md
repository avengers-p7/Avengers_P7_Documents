# Declarative Pipeline-Go Lang Code Compilation
Building and deploying Go APIs can be streamlined through continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Declarative pipelines in Jenkins offer a robust and readable approach to automate Go code compilation. 
Declarative pipelines use Jenkins DSL, a Groovy-based domain-specific language, to define pipeline stages and steps in a more structured and human-readable format. This promotes maintainability and easier understanding of the build process.

# Code-Compilation Setup 
**Step-1** Create a New Pipeline Job:

- Navigate to the Jenkins dashboard and click on New Item.
- Enter a name for your job (e.g., "Declarative pipeline-Golang-Code Compilation").
- Select Pipeline and click OK.

**Step-2** Configure Pipeline Script:

- In the job configuration page, scroll down to the Pipeline section.
- Select Pipeline script from SCM.
- Give required repo url and enter your credentials.

**Step-3** Save the Configuration:

- Click on Save to save the job configuration.

**Step-4** Build the Pipeline:

- Once the pipeline configuration is saved, you can manually trigger the build by clicking on Build Now.

**Step-5** View Build Console Output:

- After triggering the build, you can view the progress and console output of the build by clicking on the build number in the Jenkins dashboard.
- The console output will display the steps executed by the pipeline script, including code checkout and compilation.
- Verify Successful Compilation:

[JenkinsFile](https://github.com/avengers-p7/Jenkinsfile/blob/main/Declarative%20Pipeline/golang_code-compilation/Jenkinsfile)

``` shell
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    tools {
        // Define the Go tool installation named 'Go' using the configured path
        go 'go1.22.0'
    }
    
    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps { 
                git branch: 'main', credentialsId: 'khushi_cred', url: 'https://github.com/OT-MyGurukulam/employee-api.git'
            }
        }
        stage('Code Compilation') {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Use the 'go' tool to run Go commands
                    sh 'go install' 
                    sh "go list -f '{{.Target}}'"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

# Conclusion
Declarative pipeline offers a simpler, more structured approach to defining Jenkins pipelines, making it ideal for teams looking to streamline their CI/CD processes and improve pipeline readability, maintainability, and scalability.
