# Introduction

This documentation presents the development and usage of a shared library for Slack notification. The shared library includes common functions for sending notifications to Slack channels. The purpose of this library is to streamline the process of integrating Slack notifications into various applications, reducing duplication of code and ensuring consistency in notification functionality across different projects.

# What is Shared Library?

<img width="400" alt="image" src="https://github.com/avengers-p7/Documentation/assets/156057205/e55d86c5-ce1b-4a40-be43-6d59b4177419">

A shared library in Jenkins is a reusable collection of Groovy scripts that can be used by multiple Jenkins jobs.Shared libraries provide a way to efficiently share code and resources among multiple programs, promoting code reuse, efficient memory usage, and easier maintenance and updates.Each shared library requires users to define a name and a method of retrieving source code. These methods include local files, Git repositories, and Jenkins SCM plugins. Optionally, users can also set a default library version.

***

# Why Shared Library

| **Reason** | **Description** |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| **Reusability** | Shared libraries allow developers to write code once and reuse it in multiple programs, reducing duplication of effort and making maintenance easier. |
| **Dynamic Linking** |  When a program uses a shared library, the code from the library is not directly included in the program's executable file. Instead, references to the library are included, and the actual library code is loaded into memory at runtime when the program is executed. |
| **Efficient Memory Usage** | Since shared libraries are loaded into memory only once, even if multiple programs are using them simultaneously, they can help conserve system resources and reduce memory usage. |
| **Updates and Maintenance** |  If a shared library is updated or patched to fix bugs or add features, all programs that use that library can benefit from the changes without needing to be recompiled. |

# Slack Notification Setup

Setting up Slack notifications in Jenkins involves integrating Jenkins with Slack using a Jenkins plugin and configuring the necessary settings in both Jenkins and Slack.

**Step-1 Workspace Creation**

Different projects or teams may have different Jenkins jobs with unique notification requirements. Using separate workspaces in Slack allows for the isolation and organization of notifications related to specific projects or teams.

Go to the Slack website.Click on "Get started for free" or "Create a new workspace."Follow the prompts to set up your Slack workspace, providing details such as your email address and password.

***

**Step-2 Channel Creation**

Creating a dedicated channel for Jenkins notifications helps isolate and organize build-related messages.

Log in to your Slack workspace.In the left sidebar, click on the "+" button next to "Channels."Choose "Create a channel."

***

**Step-3 Jenkins CI Setup**

This step includes the steps for "Password" or "Secret Text" creation,which is an important part for Slack Notification.With this,will get the "Team Subdomain" & "Password" which is needed for jenkins slack notification configuration.

***

**Step-4 Jenkins Configuration** 

Setting up Jenkins Global Configuration for Slack notifications allows you to centralize and manage Slack-related settings at a global level. This global configuration provides a convenient way to store and share common information, such as Slack team domain and integration tokens, across multiple Jenkins jobs.

Go to "Manage Jenkins" > "Configure System."Scroll down to the "Slack" section.In the "Team Domain" field, enter the Slack team domain.In the "Integration Token Credential" section, click on "Add" to add your Slack integration token as a Jenkins credential.Enter the necessary information, such as the token itself and an ID to identify the credential.In the "Test Connection" section, enter a Slack channel name and click on "Test Connection" to verify that Jenkins can communicate with Slack.

    }
    if (status == 'FAILURE'){
            slackSend channel: 'jenkinss', message: 'Job Failed '
